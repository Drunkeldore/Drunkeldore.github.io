# Who am I?
![](/assets/images/well-me.jpg){:height="360" width="360" padding="10" style="float:left"}My name is Nick, I'm a recent Computer Science graduate and hobbyist software developer looking to get into the field professionally. I currently work as a fits-all Paraprofessional at an all special needs school. It is incredibly rewarding work and provides a unique environment to apply my skillset. I've worked extensively on augmented and alternate forms of communications and even focused on it for my degree capstone project. I have also worked alongside students to develop 3D printed solutions for their communication devices. My work has given me the opportunity to meet a wide variety of wonderful and unique staff/students. 

Outside of my less than traditional Parapro role I am also a certified Emotional Support Animal handler. Wellington, my big fluffy boy, has helped me in dozens of crisis responses. I couldn't see myself doing my job without him, and feel like he's another extension of me and what we have to offer. 

I have thoroughly enjoyed working in special needs education and will always continue to help in anyway I can.

I've been a gamer my whole life, I've met my lifelong friends and even connected with my wife through videogames. I also like to get outside and touch grass. I recently started gardening and I am in the process of building a greenhouse. I also enjoying fishing whenever I can, which is never enough.

# So You Code?
I love to code. Problem solving gives me a rush and I love that I can always be learning **something**. I dove headfirst into coding when I tried *and finished ;)* Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python on Udemy. It's what gave me the confidence to go back and get my degree. I've mostly worked with Python, but have dabbled in java, js, and C++. I've worked with libraries like Flask and Django, and as of creating this website, started learning how to use Jekyll. I started playing with machine learning and computer vision a bit more when I worked with TensorFlow for the first time while doing my capstone. Check out my Projects section to see how I implemented a CNN to identify pictures of sign language. 

# What's Next For Me
I am a life time learner. I get excited thinking about the next library I might find or silly little problem I want to "solve". *My wife might argue a bit on the definition of solved* My next chapter in life started about a month ago when my daughter was born. I can't imagine life without her. It's changed **everything**. *Parenthood is wild*

I'm ready to continue that chapter into the future. I want to use my experiences and skills to help others find what does ***it*** for them.
