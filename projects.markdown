# Sign Language -> Text CNN CS Capstone 
<hr>
[![Link to github repo](/assets/images/cnn_model.png)](https://github.com/Drunkeldore/CS-capstone){:style="float: left"}
My capstone project was about creating a [convolutional neural network](https://www.ibm.com/topics/convolutional-neural-networksjekyll-organization) that was trained on a large set of images of sign language. The intention fo the project is to convert an image to the signed letter where it can be printed out and read by the user. Included in the project are a series of graphs that show it's accuracy and changes during training. 


The project was built using TensorFlow's Keras module and many data libraries like scikit-learn, numpy, seaborn, and more.

My wife and I spent a lot of time playing Pokemon GO during quarantine. We got tired of the interface used to give and receive daily gifts. The project only works on Android and requires a connection directly to the PC. If I ever go back to it I would like to make it work remotely, and also solve the timing issue with something better than forced sleeps.

The app navigates to and cycles the friendslist. It uses matplotlib to take screenshots and a rgb/pixel check function to see what color exists in a pixel range. I created a little GUI using TKinter as well, just to give it a slight polish. The app itself is pretty simple, but I really enjoyed watching the code imitate touch commands on the phone.
